# 🛳️ Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Objective
Perform exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to discover insights and patterns related to passenger survival.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📁 Files Included
- `train.csv` – Dataset used for analysis
- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with complete code and visualizations
- `Titanic_EDA_Report.pdf` – PDF report exported from notebook
- `README.md` – This file

---

## 📊 Key Steps Performed

1. Loaded and explored the Titanic dataset using `pandas`.
2. Handled missing values in 'Age', 'Embarked' and dropped 'Cabin'.
3. Created new features like `FamilySize` and `IsAlone`.
4. Visualized distributions and survival rates using:
   - Countplots
   - Histograms
   - Boxplots
   - Heatmaps
5. Identified important patterns and correlations.

## 🧠 Summary of Insights

- 🧍‍♀️ Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- 🛏️ Passengers from **Pclass 1** had the best survival rates.
- 💸 Higher **fare** correlated with better survival chances.
- 👪 Passengers with family had higher chances than those traveling alone.
- 🔧 The `Cabin` column had too many missing values and was dropped.
- 📊 Correlation heatmap showed that `Fare` and `Pclass` influence survival.

## 📦 Outcome
Gained hands-on experience with:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and visualization
- Feature engineering
